# Hi, I'm Drake Rogers

I'm a full stack developer and software engineering student with a passion for building tools that solve real problems. I enjoy working across the stack — from backend APIs to responsive, accessible frontends — and I'm especially drawn to developer tooling, data, and automation.

## What I'm Working On

- Developing my personal portfolio using Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript
- Planning a full-stack hot sauce recipe tracker app to showcase CRUD, filtering, and user-authenticated content
- Continuing to refine my React and Python fundamentals while writing clean, accessible UI components
- Writing and sharing dev articles to document what I learn and help others starting out

## Skills & Focus Areas

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, HTML/CSS, responsive UI design
- Backend: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Django, Flask, FastAPI
- Tools: Git, GitHub, Vite, Next.js, REST APIs
- Growth Areas: Clean architecture, component design, full-stack testing, and production deployment

## Fun Fact

## Fun Fact

When I’m not coding, I’m growing chili peppers on my lanai in Hawaiʻi and crafting hot sauces from scratch. It started as a hobby and turned into the inspiration for my next full-stack project — a hot sauce recipe tracker that blends my love for food, gardening, and building tools that actually get used.
