- 👋 Hi, I’m @drakrgrs
- 👀 I’m interested in Full Stack Web development and software engineering. I currently use the PERN Stack to develop applications using JavaScript. I am also proficient in Python and have started working with algorithms to transition into machine learning. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write algorithmic solutions to problems using Python, as well as learning how to use Pyhton/Flask/MongoDB to develop applications instead of the PERN stack.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source contributions, or am actively seeking employment as a web application developer. 
- 📫 How to reach me the best way to reach me is through linked in, or on my instagram @drakedrogers.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am working on a bachelor's degree in sustainable agriculture, and currently grow my own chili peppers and make hot sauces using nothing but regenerative sources of pest and disease control in addition to natural fertilizer.
